The four main types of ukulele (soprano, concert, tenor and baritone) each have their own standard tuning. However, it has become more common for the three smallest types of ukulele to all be tuned to G-C-E-A. While the standard tuning of the soprano ukulele is A4-D4-F#4-B4, it is now almost exclusively tuned down to the 'concert' tuning of G4-C4-E4-A4. The tenor on the other hand has two common G-C-E-A tunings, involving either a high-G or low-G. While the high-G tenor tuning is exactly the same as the concert and soprano tuning (G4-C4-E4-A4), the low-G tuning breaks away from the standard ukulele re-entrant tuning by lowering the G-string by an octave (G3-C4-E4-A4). The baritone ukulele is the most differently tuned of the four types of ukulele, as it is tuned to the same pitch as the four-highest strings of the guitar, with the scientific pitch: D3-G3-B3-E4.

The standard G4-C4-E4-A4 tuning of the ukulele is different from most other stringed instruments as the strings are not tuned from highest to lowest. Instead, the lowest string (the C-string) is placed in the middle of the higher-pitched G-string and E-string. This tuning is known as re-entrant tuning, and it is a feature that adds to the unique personality of the ukulele. You may have heard this tuning referred to as the 'My Dog Has Fleas' tuning, which is simply a little ditty that is commonly used to help players memorise the pitches of the ukulele strings in relation to one another.

The strings of the ukulele are tightened or loosened to produce the right note by the tuners (otherwise known as tuning pegs or pegs) which are located in the head of the ukulele, with pegs either to the side or pointing backwards. Most tuners have small gears attached to them to make turning the tuner smoother and easier, although tuning set-ups on cheap models of ukulele are known to slip very easily, causing the ukulele to go out of tune.

If you are just beginning to tune your ukulele, then it is a good idea to use a chromatic tuner to start off with. Chromatic tuners register the sound you are playing, and let you know if the note you have played is too sharp or too flat. If you have a microphone for your computer, or your computer has an in-built microphone, then you can use our Chromatic Instrument Tuner. Once you start to become familiar with the standard pitch of the ukulele strings (or if you already feel that you have a good ear), you may like to progress on to using a tuner that plays a note. To tune with a tuner that plays a note, you simply try to match the sound of your string to the reference note by turning the tuning peg higher or lower as needed. Check out our Online Ukulele Tuner to give it a go with your ukulele!

When tuning any instrument, you should always tune from below the note, up. This prevents string breakages and over-stretching the string. Tuning from below the note also helps to systematize the process of tuning, so you eventually become more familiar with the sound of a perfectly in-tune string. If you finish tuning your ukulele by lowering the string, then your string will often fall flat quicker. This is because when you loosen strings, leftover slack in the string often remains behind the nut and is released as you pluck and strum. To remedy this, play a few chords after you have tuned with a hard strum or stretch the strings out a little at the nut to release any slack that may have built up, then check the tuning of your ukulele again.

When you are tuning your ukulele, it helps to pluck the string with the same finger (or with your thumb) every time you check the pitch of the string so that the sound that you hear remains consistent. Let the note ring after you have plucked the string as this will help you to hear the note better. If your strings are new, you may need to tune very frequently while the strings get used to being stretched. This may mean that you have to stop and tune part-way through playing; and it is very possible you may even need to re-tune more than once during a practice.

The ukulele can be tuned using various different methods. You can tune a ukulele using a tuner, a piano, pitch pipes, or you can tune the ukulele to itself. Whatever way your chose to tune your ukulele, it is always best to unwind the string at least half a turn before you tune to prevent the string from being overstretched. Down-tuning like this will also help your ear to register when the pitch of the string is back in-tune. This rule applies any way you tune the ukulele - whether you are using a tuner that picks up the sound of your ukulele, or if you are tuning to a sounded note.

Whatever way you chose to tune, it is advisable to start by tuning the C string first, followed by the E string, then the G and A. Tuning your strings in order from highest-pitch to lowest-pitch helps you to recognise the distance in pitch between one string and another. Also, the 'C4' note itself is a great reference pitch to memorise - you may know it by its more common name; 'middle C'.

It helps to make several passes with each of the strings when you tune. Strings stretch, and often by the time you have finished tuning your instrument the first string you tuned will be out by a little bit (especially if your strings were well out-of-tune to begin with). Also, the increasing or decreasing tension on the strings when you tune them can make the body of the ukulele bend very slightly. This is completely normal, but may cause the strings to change slightly in pitch as you are tuning. Making two or three passes on your strings when you tune will help with this. Strings that are tuned precisely also tend to stay in tune for longer, so it is very worth putting that little bit of extra effort in when tuning to make sure that your tuning is as precise as you can make it.

Common Ukulele Tuning Problems

As low-end ukuleles are produced very cheaply, many of these models are plagued by manufacturing faults that cause issues with the tuning of the ukulele. Some of these problems can be fixed, while others unfortunately require replacement parts, or a replacement instrument. When you go to purchase a ukulele it pays to keep this in mind as usually a few simple checks in-store will let you know whether or not you will have trouble with the tuning of the ukulele. If in doubt, always ask the music retailer specifically whether or not they have experienced any problems with the tuning of the specific model you are looking at. Ask specifically about the fretting of the model too, as inaccurate fretting can't be fixed.

If you find that your ukulele slips out of tune easily, it could be due to several different reasons. Usually with new strings, you will find that they stretch out over a period of a few days. In this case, it's just a matter of playing out the slack in the new strings. However, if you start with your strings at a higher tension and tune down to the right note at the start of your practice, then it is possible that slack has built up behind the nut, which is then released as you pick or strum away at the strings. Check that this is not the case first, by stretching the strings out from the nut and then tuning back up to the correct note. If you don't think that your tuning is the problem, then it may be that your tuning peg is slipping. Most ukuleles have a machine-style tuning head, with a gear attached. Make sure that all the screws attached to the tuning peg/heads are tight (using a small screwdriver, tighten in small increments being careful not to over-tighten the screws) and check to see if this makes a difference. If not, it is probable that you will need to buy some better quality tuners.

If you are finding that your ukulele seems to just not sound quite right, especially on the higher frets (closer to the body of the ukulele) then you may have a fretting problem. Fretting problems are quite common on cheaper models of ukulele, and can make it sound like you are playing out-of-tune. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to fix inaccurate fretting, so it is always best to check to see if an instrument is fretted well before you buy it.

Quick-Reference Tuning Tips

Tuning a ukulele is easy if you follow these simple tips:

Top Tip: Remember to always tune from below the note to prevent strings from over-stretching or even breaking.

Tune the C string first, followed by the E, G then A string. Tuning from low to high like this helps you to hear the pitch of the string. Alternatively you may like to tune using the 'My dog has fleas' ditty, if you find that helps you memorise the pitches of the strings better.

If you are using a tuner that sounds a note like our Online Ukulele Tuner, then try humming the right note from the tuner before you tune, so you know exactly what note you are looking for. If you can't reach the note with your voice, then just visualise humming it. This process has the effect of tuning in your brain and ears so they are on the same page.

Flex the string at the nut after tuning and then re-tune for the most accurate tuning result. Stretching slack out of the string will also help your strings remain in tune longer, so long as your tuning head itself isn't prone to slipping.

How to Tune the Ukulele to Itself
The ukulele is a beautiful piece that stands alone as a unique fretted stringed instrument. Although many may associate the ukulele with the guitar, the ukulele is unique in that it lends a large portion of its sound to rhythm and beat-keeping, as opposed to the more melodic and technical sound that is characteristic of the guitar. That being said, the ukulele is a still a tonal instrument and, thus, still relies heavily on proper intonation (tuning) in completing its sound.

There are several ways to tune the ukulele to itself. There is a method in which you use adjacent strings to tune a string. There is also a non-adjacent string method. The non-adjacent string method is more effective on the ukulele than the adjacent string method, which is preferred on the guitar. A guitarist would probably use the adjacent string tuning method whilst attempting to tune the ukulele, while a true ukulele player will almost always use the non-adjacent method. I will explain why the non-adjacent method is more effective after I show you what exactly it is.

Before anybody attempts to do any tuning by ear, they must understand that tuning by ear is something that is only possible for SOME people. If a player cannot tune their instrument using Get-Tuned's Online Ukulele Tuner, that player WILL NOT be able to use this method. This method is what I call a "road tool", or something to resort to only when there is no other tuning method readily available. If, for example, you bring your ukulele on a camping trip, and so you can't log on to the internet to pull up the ukulele tuner, this method will allow you to tune your ukulele to ITSELF, so you will be able to play ALONE. Keep in mind that two instruments tuned with this method will not necessarily be in tune with each other, and they almost always won't be. Players in this situation will need to make sure that every string is in tune with its counterpart on the other instrument. This problem is easily solved by having one player tune his instrument to itself, and then having the other player tune each of her strings to each corresponding string on the first player's ukulele.

Now, on to the good stuff. Please keep in mind that this article is specific to standard ukulele tuning, which is:

Standard Ukulele Tuning
This is the tuning which most ukuleles will be in when they are on display in a shop, and it is also the tuning used by almost all beginners. For this method to work, the player must choose one string which he will arbitrarily assign as "in tune". I typically choose the E string, although technically the G and A strings tend to stay in tune best, out of all the strings. Still, for simplicity's sake, let's choose the E string, which is the highlighted above, to be our "in tune" string. Now that we've designated E as being "in tune," there is no need to tune the E string at all.

Step 1: Using the "in tune" E string as a reference, we will begin tuning the rest of the instrument. Let's begin with the G string. The third fret on the E string will give the note G, so the player should play both the open G string and the third fret on the E string and hear the same note. If these pitches are not exactly the same, carefully but deliberately adjust the tuner attached to the G string (NOT the E string) until the pitches match. This is step one on the second figure.
Step 2: Now that you have the E and G strings in tune with each other, you can move on to the A string. The second fret on the G string will produce an A pitch, so play this along with the open A string. If these pitches are not exactly the same, adjust the tuner attached to the A string (NOT the G string) until the pitches are exactly the same. Now we are almost entirely in tune, aside from the C string, which brings us to step three.
Step 3: The third fret on the A string will give a C, exactly one octave above the open C string. Play both the third fret on the A string and open on the C string and you should hear an exact octave interval (same note, but one is lower pitched than the other). If the octave is NOT perfect, adjust the tuner attached to the C string (NOT the A string) until the octave is perfect.
Here is an image to help aid in understanding the process.

Tuning an Ukulele To Itself Using Non Adjacent Strings
Each number on the image corresponds to the step number, and the position your finger should be in to properly produce each tone. Each number is attached to a different string by a line; this shows which open string corresponds to each fretted note. Hopefully this helps visually show what I'm trying to demonstrate.

If all three steps are done correctly, the ukulele should be exactly in tune with itself! Verify this by playing an open C chord; hold the third fret on the A string, and leave all the remaining strings open. Strum all the strings together at once, and, if properly tuned, you should hear a beautiful C major chord! (If you hear something "ugly," you've probably failed to properly tune the instrument. Try starting over!)

Different Ways to Tune a Ukulele to Itself

There are cumulatively quite a few different ways in which you can tune your ukulele to itself, and the best method to do this will often depend on the context in which you are playing. For example, if you are playing along with a guitar, you may want to tune your G-string as your initial reference string as the guitar's G-string is the exact same note in the same octave as the ukulele's G-string. Technically you can use any string as your initial reference string, and it is often best to choose the string that is the least out-of-tune, especially if you do not have a tuner on hand. In order to be able to tune a ukulele to itself using any starting string, you need to have a good idea of where all the fretted open-string notes are on your ukulele (the places to put your fingers on the frets to find the notes G, C, E and A). As the C-string is the lowest string on the ukulele, you will not find a 'C' reference note in the same octave as your C-string. You can still tune your C-string to a reference 'C' that is an octave higher - just be aware that this will sound slightly different compared to playing an identical reference note. The handy tab below shows you all the common fret reference notes for the open strings. Using this tab, you should be able to tune your ukulele from any starting reference string!

Tuning your Ukulele using 'Middle-C'

Start by getting the C-string as close to in-tune as you can by ear, and then tune the rest of the ukulele strings off the C-string. The ukulele will then be in tune with itself, and it will sound in-tune, even if every string is a little sharp or flat.

Using the image above as a reference, tune your ukulele using the following steps:

Make sure that your C-string is in tune (either by using a tuner, tuning from 'middle C' on a piano, or by tuning the C-string as close as you can by ear).

Put a finger on the fourth fret of your tuned C-string. The note you are holding down is 'E' - the exact same note as your E-string! Use the reference 'E' (the one you are holding down with your finger) to tune your E-string until the two notes sound the same.

Now that your E-string is in-tune, you can use this string to help tune your other strings. Put a finger on the third fret of your E-string. The note you are holding down is 'G' - the exact same note as your G-string. Again, use your reference G to tune your G-string.

To tune the final string (the A-string) put a finger on the second fret of your G-string. This note is 'A' and you can use it to tune your A-string.

A:----------0--:
E:--0---3------:
C:--4----------:
G:------0---2--:
As a general rule, it is best to tune to the reference note that uses the lowest fret possible. This is for several reasons. Most ukuleles are constructed economically, meaning that the fretting of the instrument isn't always exactly perfect. Also, the nylon strings of the ukulele allow the player to adjust the pitch of a fretted note simply by adjusting the amount of pressure being put onto the string (or by stretching the string slightly to one side). These characteristics of the ukulele can cause tonal distortion. The possible impact of tonal distortion increases as the player moves further up the fret board, towards the body. So the further you are fretting from the head of the uke, the more out-of-tune each note will be. When fretting reference notes closest to the head of the ukulele, you are minimising the impact the tonal distortion will have on your tuning.

Alternate Tunings for the Ukulele
There are several different alternative tunings that are commonly used on the soprano, concert, tenor and baritone ukuleles. It is probable that you will come across music that uses these alternative tunings if you play one of these ukulele types; so it is good to become familiar with these tunings even if you are not planning on using them yourself anytime soon. We encourage you to use our Adjustable Online Ukulele Tuner to help you tune your ukulele to these alternate tunings.

Soprano

Soprano ukuleles are technically supposed to be standard-tuned to A4-D4-F#4-B4, although it is more common these days to see the soprano tuned down to G4-C4-E4-A4 tuning. In the A4-D4-F#4-B4 tuning, each string is tuned one tone higher than with the G4-C4-E4-A4 tuning. It is thought that the slightly higher key produced by A4-D4-F#4-B4 tuning makes the ukulele sound more traditional or Hawaiian. This is because the original Hawaiian ukuleles were a little smaller than the models available today, and so the strings on the earlier instruments were more often tuned ADF#B, as this produced better string-tension. You will likely come across this alternative tuning for the soprano, especially if you delve in to playing traditional Hawaiian music.

You can easily tune your ukulele to ADF#B from GCEA, by using your A-string to tune your G-string up to A. Once your G-string has been tuned up to A you can tune the other three strings up using G-string reference notes (see Tuning the Ukulele to Itself for more information on how to tune using this method). Holding a finger down on the 2nd fret of your tuned-up G-string will produce a reference 'B', and holding down the 5th fret on your tuned-up G-string will produce a reference 'D'. To tune your E-string up to F#, hold down the 4th fret on your B-string (tuned up C-string).

There are many other variations on soprano tuning, which are mainly used to compliment different genres or styles of playing. For example, country musicians tend to borrow ukulele tunings from the tunings or alternative tunings other instruments like the banjo and the mandolin. Secondary alternative tunings are not widely used, unless called for by a particular piece of music or ensemble arrangement. Sometimes soprano ukuleles are tuned out of their re-entrant tuning to increase their range or melodic playability. Fifths tuning is popular for this effect, with the strings tuned G-D-A-E.

Concert

Alternative tunings for the concert ukulele tend to be similar or the same as the soprano alternative tunings, mainly because they are very close in size. The soprano A4-D4-F#4-B4 standard-tuning can be used on the concert ukulele; although it is argued by some ukulele players that the soprano tuning increases the string tension too drastically on a concert model, causing the ukulele to be harder to play with a more tense (rather than a classic 'clangy') sound. When A4-D4-F#4-B4 tuning is used on a concert, it is usually used for the same reasons as it is on a soprano - it is thought that this tuning produces a brighter, clearer tone more suited to playing traditional Hawaiian music. You can tune your concert ukulele up in exactly the same way as you would tune up a soprano ukulele (mentioned above), however its best to ease up on the strings a wee bit; give them more of a chance to adjust to the higher tension and take the up-tuning slowly;, as it will be quite a significant increase in tension because of the increased distance between the nut and the bridge.

Ukuleles have a reasonably long history, and alternative tunings for the instrument have come and gone. The lower key tuning of the concert used to be popular with American ukulele players in the Jazz age, especially for soloist performances. Tuning your concert down to B-flat or A can still be done with pleasing results, but finding music for these tunings is a challenge, as the market is currently dominated by G-C-E-A tuning resources.

Other variations of concert tuning tend to follow the same mold as with the soprano, with alternative tunings being used mainly to complement different styles or genres of music or different ensembles. The concert ukulele can be tuned in fifths also, with the tuning of: C-G-D-A. Again the same reasons as for the fifth tuning of the soprano can be cited - fifth tuning allows for easier melodic playability.

Tenor

The tenor ukulele is slightly bigger than the concert ukulele, and it has a significantly longer fretboard. The tenor ukulele has two G-C-E-A tunings, known commonly as high-G and low-G tuning. High-G tuning is the same tuning as the concert and soprano (G4-C4-E4-A4). Critics of the high-G tuning state that the body of the tenor is not suited to producing the high re-entrant ukulele sound, although high-G tuning is very popular and many newly manufactured tenor ukuleles are strung with all-nylon strings to accommodate high-G tuning. Low-G tuning is tuned with the G-string an octave lower (to G3). Low-G tuning is criticized for its lack of traditional ukulele sound, as it forgoes the re-entrant tuning and sounds more full-bodied, like a guitar. Low-G tuning has its advantages however, and many ukulele soloists prefer the low-G tuning as it allows for a greater melodic range, and some fingerpicking skills are definitely more transferrable between the guitar and the low-G tenor ukulele. Low-G tuned tenor ukuleles often have a metal wound G-string, which produces a deeper more mellow sound than the harshness of re-entrant tuned ukuleles.

There are a few other alternative tunings for the tenor ukulele, however these are much rarer than the high-G and low-G tunings. With the right strings the tenor can be tuned down to D-G-B-E (like the baritone ukulele) and occasionally the low-G string may be tuned down to a C to produce a greater tonal range. Tenor ukuleles can also be tuned in fifths or fourths if desired, however these tunings aren't overly common.

Baritone

The standard tuning of the baritone ukulele is non-reentrant. The strings are tuned D3-G3-B3-E4 from low to high, which is exactly the same tuning as the top four strings of the guitar. Some ukulele purists don't think the baritone should be classified as a ukulele for this reason. This is perhaps the main reason why the baritone is alternatively tuned to re-entrant tuning. The baritone can be alternatively re-entrant tuned to G-C-E-A (in accordance with the other three ukulele types), or to D-G-B-E, with the D string an octave higher than non-re-entrant tuning. The G-C-E-A tuning of the baritone ukulele requires a different set of strings to the baritone strings used for standard-tuning, and the high-D tuning of the baritone ukulele requires a different D-string. Some models of baritone ukulele are sold with re-entrant tuned strings, however these models are much rarer than those baritone ukes that are sold tuned to the standard D-G-B-E tuning.
